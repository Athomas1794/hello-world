# hello-world
First github repository for learning

Welcome to my readme. You're probably wondering, why isn't this private?
And to that I say, my learning and mistakes should be open source. Why? 
Well documentation is very important and I like it, so thats the real reason.
You can only make progress if you document what you've done, because otherwise you
only think in one state of being and forget where you used to be. Until we're robots
or timelords, we can only think in one mindset at a time. Thank you for reading my readme
and tell my parents I love them if this is my only surviving work :)
